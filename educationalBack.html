                <h3>Experience within the industry</h3>
                <p>I have no full time work experience but I have visited two diffirent companies with the intention to learn about the work environment.</p>
                <p>The first was SAIL Minerals; a mining company that specialsizes in chrome mining, logistics and supply. 
                   I visited for a week and in this week I learned about system development and deployment within the company. I attended a meeting about solving 
                problems that occurred within the system and saw a practical representation of problem solving within the work place. The times that I was not learning about the system of the company 
                I helped assempble laptops with new parts.</p>
                <p>The second was DeARX; a software development company. I also visited this company for a week and within this week I learned what 
                    it takes to develop software for other companies. The amount of team work and understanding that goes into the development of software is almost as important 
                    as all the seperate parts.
